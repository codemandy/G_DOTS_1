Stochastic screening: Stochastic (FM) screening: Uses dots of the same size but varies their spacing. To create a lighter tone, the dots are spaced farther apart. To create a darker tone, the dots are printed closer together. 
Blue Noise Dithering



•  Light to dark: Prevents dark colors from muddying light ones 
•  Consider transparency: More transparent colors first




I recommend this progression:
1.	MVP (Minimum Viable Plotter): 
o	Single color (black)
o	Floyd-Steinberg dithering
o	Simple tap dots
o	Get something plotting TODAY
2.	Add sophistication: 
o	2-3 color palette
o	Test different dithering algorithms
o	Path optimization
3.	Refinement: 
o	Custom color separation
o	Variable dot sizes
o	Advanced stippling algorithms
4.	Polish: 
o	GUI for parameter adjustment
o	Real-time preview
o	Library of presets for different aesthetics
